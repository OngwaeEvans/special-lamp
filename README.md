üìò Python Assignment 1 ‚Äì Programming Fundamentals
This project contains solutions to a university-level Python programming assignment that focuses on foundational programming concepts, mathematical modeling, data visualization, numerical integration, and theoretical understanding of programming language types.

üß† Overview
This assignment demonstrates the practical application of Python in solving real-world and academic problems using:

Basic arithmetic and sequence generation

Data visualization using matplotlib

Numerical integration with scipy

Conceptual understanding of compiled vs interpreted languages

Each question is handled in its own script with clear structure and output. Below is a breakdown of each task:
